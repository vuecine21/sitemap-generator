### How to use Sitemap Generator


1. **Click the extension icon** in the top right corner

2. Session configuration window will open. In this window **set your preferences** then click start.

3. The sitemap **generator will launch** in a separate window. You may let this window run in the background. If you wish to terminate the generator for any reason before it completes independently, there is a button to terminate the session.

4. On completion, the **generated sitemap will download** and you can also see it in your downloads folder. This is also the case if you terminate the generator manually, however in that case your sitemap may not include all urls.

{% include_relative ga.html %}
